Last time we talked about [Third-Party Dependency Management](/en/2020/03/15/cmake-2-third-party-dependances-management/) and mentioned our team's use of `ExternalProject` to manage dependencies. This time, let's discuss the practical implementation and an open-source dependency management tool based on CMake, [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

### ExternalProject Practice

Let's take a look at what it looks like:

```cmake
ExternalProject_Add(<name> [<option>...])
ExternalProject_Add_Step(<name> <step> [<option>...])
ExternalProject_Get_Property
ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(<name> [NO_DEPENDS] <step1> [<step2>...])
```

It may look simple, but it's not, as the documentation makes it seem due to the multitude of options availableâ€”surprised yet?

In fact, most of the parameters are unnecessary for basic use. I will select some commonly used parameters and discuss them. The steps are mainly divided as follows:

- **Directory Configuration**
    - **PREFIX**: Directory prefix, choose one that you find visually appealing;
    - **DOWNLOAD_DIR**: This is important; it's recommended to choose a directory at the same level as the build directory, so it serves as a cache directory after the build directory is deleted, saving download time on subsequent builds;
- **Download**
    - **URL & URL_HASH**: Download and verification of the package, recommended even for Git projects, as it can further reduce download times (especially cloning from GitHub in China);
    - **GIT_REPOSITORY & GIT_TAG**: Cloning of Git projects, it's advisable to add `GIT_SHALLOW` to reduce the clone size;
- **Update**
    - **PATCH_COMMAND**: This can modify the source files after they're fetched, such as for temporary bug fixes, especially since project maintainers may not always make timely changes;
- **Configuration**
    - **CONFIGURE_COMMAND**: For non-CMake projects, this parameter allows running configuration commands like `./configure --prefix=${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}`, also set `BUILD_IN_SOURCE true`;
    - **CMAKE_ARGS**: Configuration parameters for CMake projects, like `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}`;
- **Build**
    - Mostly skippable;
- **Test**
    - **TEST_COMMAND**: If you need to test the build on the machine, set this; otherwise, it's often skippable, just leave it empty: `TEST_COMMAND ""`;
- **Install**
    - **INSTALL_COMMAND**: Also mostly skippable, executes the standard `make install` command, but can be changed if not using this command;
- **Others**
    - **DEPENDS**: If there are other dependencies, configure this option; it will clarify these dependencies' relationships and then compile them in order;

As you can see, I configure `prefix` as `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}` to install all third-party dependencies into a configurable unified directory, which makes it easy to bundle them together. Additionally, if there are dependency relationships, most issues can be automatically resolved.

Regarding `ExternalProject_Add_Step` and the other two, they are not used much, but they can be useful if you want to compile documentation. While `ExternalProject_Get_Property` has some use when you compile `ExternalProject` as a main project build step, it is generally not used since it's not downloaded and built at configuration time, considering methods like `target_link_libraries` need you to already have the build products.

After compiling, you can package all the build artifacts and upload them to a public storage space. Then, simply write a download step in the main `CMakeLists.txt`. This way, all your team members can save time on compiling third-party code.

The specific code is left as homework, hints as follows:

```cmake
file(DOWNLOAD <url> <file> [...])
file(UPLOAD <file> <url> [...])
```

You might think this process is somewhat tedious, but fear not, I'll introduce a very convenient tool next.

### vcpkg

Here, I must praise Microsoft for contributing many products and tools to the open-source community this year, with vcpkg being one of them.

Simply put, it is a package management tool based on CMake. Once installed, most dependencies can be installed with a single command, and more and more third-party packages are starting to accept and offer vcpkg support. Although it hasn't encompassed all third-party packages yet, and there are certain issues with cross-compiling, I believe vcpkg could be one of the candidates if there's an initiative to unify C/C++ package management tools.

Installation is straightforward:

```cmake
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
```

To install packages:

```cmake
vcpkg install opencv
```

Then, in your project, use `find_package`:

```cmake
find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(target ${OpenCV_LIBS})
```

Lastly, during the CMake configuration phase:

```cmake
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

For packages like OpenCV that have system support, this may not improve efficiency much, but for some less supported packages like GoogleTest, nlohmann-json, prometheus-cpp, etc., there's no need to hassle with downloading and compiling them yourself.

Later, to conveniently run vcpkg at any time, you can add it to your system PATH:

```cmake
export PATH="path/to/vcpkg/:$PATH"
```

Simple, right? However, it's still not perfect. The reason I don't use it in existing team projects is due to unresolved issues with cross-compiling. It currently supports very few cross-compilation scenarios, like for Android and iOS, where it is almost useless. I plan to wait until it's improved to use it.

Additionally, compared to my earlier solution, it still doesn't save compilation time.
